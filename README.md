RESPONSIVE LANDING PAGE
I have created an attractive, colorful, and fully responsive landing page with an interactive navigation menu. The navigation menu changes color on scroll and hover, includes a hamburger menu for mobile devices, and remains fixed and visible on all pages.

The project consists of three files:
index.html: The HTML structure with semantic elements and navigation.

styles.css: Colorful gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and responsive styling.

script.js: JavaScript for scroll-based style changes and mobile menu toggle.
